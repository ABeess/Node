## About
[Judge0](https://api.judge0.com) is a robust, scalable, and [open-source](https://github.com/judge0/judge0) **online code execution system** that can be used to build a wide range of applications that need online code execution features. Some examples include competitive programming platforms, e-learning platforms, candidate assessment and recruitment platforms, online code editors, online IDEs, and many more.

In our research paper [*Robust and Scalable Online Code Execution System*](https://paper.judge0.com) we present Judge0's modern modular architecture that can be easily deployed and scaled. We study its design, comment on the various challenges that arise in building such systems, and compare it with other available online code execution systems and online judge systems.

To see Judge0 in action, try [Judge0 IDE](https://ide.judge0.com) - our free and open-source online code editor. You can also try using a [dummy client](/dummy-client.html) which can help you explore and test most of the features of Judge0.

**Why should you use Judge0 on RapidAPI?**

Our infrastructure behind RapidAPI allows you to focus on building your product and forget about the know-how of maintaining and scaling Judge0.

**RapidAPI plans are not (good) enough for you?**
